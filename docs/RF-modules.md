## 1. Design Context and Rationale

The repeater system described in the companion document uses up to four pluggable radio modules on a 3U Eurocard backplane (IEC 60297), in slots **A** through **D**. Each slot has a fixed **module address** (letter). The band a module covers comes from the module PCB and EEPROM, not from the slot letter — two slots can hold the same band (for example 70 cm in B and 70 cm in C).

Example default install:

- Slot A — 2 metre: 144–146 MHz, 500 kHz IQ bandwidth, 5 W TX
- Slot B — 70 cm: 432–438 MHz, 500 kHz IQ bandwidth, 5 W TX
- Slot C — 23 cm: 1240–1258 MHz, 500 kHz IQ bandwidth, 5 W TX (or a second 70 cm link module)
- Slot D — spare or expansion

Each module is a self-contained PCB that plugs into a DIN 41612 Eurocard connector slot on the backplane. It carries its own RFIC, RF front end, power amplifier, band-pass filter, T/R switch, variable attenuator, SWR bridge, and external LNA. IQ data is transported digitally over the backplane data bus. The default antenna interface is front-panel **RP-SMA**; optional **Type-N** jacks are preferred where panel space and the site coax plan allow (see [Section 9.6](#96-antenna-connector-options-rp-sma-or-type-n)).

This document specifies the RFIC(s) for these modules and the surrounding RF signal chain.

### Key differences from the OpenHT-DB handheld design

The repeater module context differs from a handheld transceiver in several important ways:

| Parameter | OpenHT-DB handheld | Repeater module |
|-----------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Form factor | Single PCB, battery-powered | 3U Eurocard (100 × 160 mm), DIN 41612 backplane connector, backplane-powered |
| IQ interface | I2S to iMX93 SoM on same PCB | I2S over backplane DIN 41612 to SpacemiT K3 |
| Audio hardware | Codec, mic, headphone | Present on module PCB — used for bench test and optional monitoring |
| Display / keypad | On chassis | Not on module — on chassis manager or remote |
| ALSA | Required (audio output to user) | Available; used for bench testing and optional direct monitoring |
| Battery / charging | On-board BMS + USB-C PD | External DC from backplane PSU rails (+12 V PA, +5 V, +3.3 V, +1.8 V) |
| USB-A (security token) | On-board | On main SBC via backplane; Nitrokey token plugged into K3 USB-A |
| Bands per PCB | Dual (VHF + UHF) | Single band per module |
| GNSS on module | No — on main SBC | No — on main SBC |
| SWR monitoring | Not applicable (handheld) | On-module SWR bridge + ADC; auto-disable on SWR > 3.0 |

All hardware present in the OpenHT-DB design is retained on the module PCB. The audio codec, microphone header, and headphone/line output are populated on all variants. In repeater operation they provide an optional audio monitoring tap and greatly simplify bench testing — an operator can plug a PC soundcard into the 3.5 mm jack during bring-up without needing the full backplane. The 3.5 mm jack is present and populated on all builds; there is no DNP variant.

## 2. Why a Custom RFIC

No existing commodity RFIC adequately covers all three bands (144 MHz, 432 MHz, 1240 MHz) with sufficient IQ bandwidth, low noise figure, a clean open digital interface, and power consumption appropriate for a modular embedded Linux SDR platform.

### LinHT and the SX1255 path

The **[LinHT](https://linux-radio.eu/)** handheld project (OpenHT lineage) uses the Semtech **SX1255** for its UHF transceiver path — a reasonable fit at 432 MHz with 500 kHz IQ bandwidth. There is **no comparable commodity transceiver IC with a clean IQ interface at 144 MHz (VHF)** in the same class: the SX1255 family does not operate below roughly 400 MHz. That gap affects LinHT as well as this repeater concept. Both need true VHF coverage, not merely a UHF chip with an external upconverter or a compromised narrowband sub-GHz part.

The repeater addresses multiband service differently — one module PCB per band (or per role), each with a purpose-narrow RFIC — but the underlying commodity-silicon problem is the same: **no single off-the-shelf part spans VHF, UHF, and 23 cm** with the IQ interface and noise figure this architecture expects.

### Commodity parts considered (summary)

The following table summarises the commodity chip gap:

| Chip | 144 MHz | 432 MHz | 1240 MHz | IQ BW | Disqualifier |
|------|:-------:|:-------:|:--------:|-------|-------------|
| SX1255 | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | 500 kHz | 400 MHz lower limit; no VHF (LinHT UHF path only) |
| CC1200 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ~200 kHz | Bandwidth too narrow; no 23 cm |
| AT86RF215 | ✗ | ✓ | ✗ | 4 MHz | 400 MHz lower limit; no VHF or 23 cm |
| LMS7002M | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | wide | 2×2 MIMO LTE/5G platform; cost and complexity (see below) |
| AD9361 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 56 MHz | 2×2 MIMO; power, size, cost (see below) |
| Si4463/Si4468 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ~1 MHz | Obsolete architecture; no clean IQ stream; no 23 cm |
| RFFC5072 | ✓ | ✓ | partial | wide | Mixer-only; requires external LNA/VCO/ADC |
| MAX2769 | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ | narrow | GNSS receiver only; not a transceiver |

### Wideband integrated transceivers (LMS7002M, AD9361)

**LMS7002M** (Lime Microsystems) is a remarkable device, and Lime's open-source stance is genuinely admirable — it has enabled a generation of SDR experimentation. For LinHT and for this repeater idea, however, it carries significant drawbacks:

- It is a **2×2 MIMO transceiver** aimed primarily at LTE and 5G research platforms. LinHT needs only a **single TX and single RX chain**; a fixed-site repeater module needs one chain per band. Much of the chip's analogue and digital complexity goes unused.
- **Cost** (roughly **$100** in low quantities) is prohibitive for an open community hardware project targeting amateur radio operators.
- While it solves the **frequency coverage** problem in one package, it introduces **cost, power, and integration overhead** that a purpose-designed RFIC on **IHP SG13G2** would avoid.

**AD9361** (Analog Devices) is in the same class: a **2×2 RF transceiver** with integrated 12-bit DACs and ADCs, wide tuning, and substantial digital backend. For a focused **1240 MHz module** — or any single-band repeater slot — that level of MIMO and converter capacity is unnecessary. Typical power is on the order of **3.3 W**, which is acceptable on a mains-powered repeater module but is also a serious concern on a **battery-powered handheld** (the LinHT context). Again, the part solves bandwidth and tuning in one die at the price of silicon area, BOM, and software stack complexity.

No commodity part in this survey covers the full 130 MHz–1300 MHz range with ≥500 kHz IQ bandwidth, sub-5 dB noise figure, full-duplex per band, and an I2S digital baseband interface compatible with Linux — **without** paying for unused MIMO channels and wideband research features.

A custom RFIC is the only clean path for the goals stated here.

The approach taken — **one dedicated RFIC per module**, each covering one amateur band (or one link role) — avoids the power and complexity penalties of a wideband transceiver covering all three bands simultaneously. Each module is a focused, optimised design.

## 3. Fabrication Process: IHP SG13G2

**IHP Microelectronics, Frankfurt (Oder), Germany** provides the only open-source PDK for a production-grade SiGe BiCMOS process. All three module RFICs are targeted to this process. **IHP SG13CMOS5L** and **GlobalFoundries 8XP** are documented as alternatives in [Alternative processes](#alternative-processes).

### Process characteristics

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Node | 130 nm BiCMOS |
| HBT type | SiGe:C npn-HBT |
| fT | up to 300–350 GHz |
| fmax | up to 450–500 GHz |
| CMOS gate length | 130 nm (1.2 V core), 3.3 V I/O available |
| Metal stack | 5 thin + 2 thick Al layers; MIM capacitors |
| PDK license | Apache 2.0 (open source) |
| EDA toolchain | KLayout, Xschem, OpenEMS, ngspice |
| PDK repository | github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK |

The SiGe HBT's fT of 300+ GHz means the transistors are operating well below their transit frequency at all three target bands (144 MHz, 432 MHz, 1240 MHz). This provides substantial margin for achieving the target noise figures and phase noise specifications without exotic circuit techniques.

### OpenMPW shuttle program

IHP runs regular OpenMPW shuttle batches for the SG13G2 and SG13CMOS5L processes. Each community slot is 2 mm². Based on the published 2025–2026 schedule, shuttles have run approximately every 1–2 months with tapeout deadlines in April, May, July, and September 2025, and an SG13G2 MPW run scheduled for October 2026. Turn-around time is approximately 8 months for SG13G2.

The single-chain die for each band (Section 11 tapeout strategy) is sized to fit within the 2 mm² community slot, making the design accessible to independent validation before any commercial production run.

### Alternative processes

The primary RFIC blocks (LNA, mixer, VCO, PA driver) depend on the SiGe HBT devices available only in SG13G2. Two additional processes are documented as alternatives for production scaling or OpenMPW prototyping where SG13G2 slots are unavailable.

**GlobalFoundries 8XP** (commercial 130 nm SiGe BiCMOS) is the production-volume fallback. The device models at sub-1.5 GHz are comparable to SG13G2, and the circuit topology is not process-specific at the target bands.

**IHP SG13CMOS5L** is a CMOS-only variant derived from the SG13 front-end, offered by IHP for open-source educational and prototyping runs. It shares the 130 nm CMOS core (1.2 V logic, 3.3 V I/O) but omits the SiGe HBT, MIM capacitors, and the upper metal layers present in SG13G2. The metal stack is four thin layers plus one 2 µm thick TopMetal (M1–M4 + TM1). An Apache 2.0 PDK is available in the IHP-Open-PDK repository (`ihp-sg13cmos5l`). Shuttle runs are scheduled more frequently and at lower cost than SG13G2.

SG13CMOS5L cannot implement the full HT13G-M or HT13G-S RFIC as specified — the noise figure, IIP3, and VCO phase noise targets require SiGe HBT performance. It remains a viable alternative for:

- Digital control logic, SPI/I2S interface blocks, and configuration registers that do not need RF devices
- Early tapeout of ADC/DAC digital back-end stubs before committing an SG13G2 RF front-end run
- Independent validation of non-RF die area and pad-frame layout within the 2 mm² OpenMPW community slot
- Designs that accept reduced RF performance using CMOS-only circuit techniques at VHF/UHF

Designs targeting SG13CMOS5L should be maintained as a separate PDK variant (`$PDK=ihp-sg13cmos5l`) alongside the primary SG13G2 netlist.

## 4. RFIC Family Overview

Two RFIC variants are specified, covering all three repeater bands:

| RFIC | Bands covered | Module(s) |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| **HT13G-M** | 130–175 MHz (VHF) + 400–480 MHz (UHF) — dual chain | 2 m module + 70 cm module (one chip, two independent chains) |
| **HT13G-S** | 1200–1300 MHz (L-band / 23 cm) — single chain | 23 cm module |

The HT13G-M is the dual-chain variant adapted from the OpenHT-DB handheld specification, with the handheld-specific interfaces (audio codec, display, battery management) removed and the backplane interfaces (I2S over DIN 41612, SPI configuration, ZeroMQ IPC) substituted.

The HT13G-S is a new single-chain design targeting the 23 cm band. The SiGe HBT process easily covers 1.2–1.3 GHz; this is well within the transistor's capabilities at fT of 300 GHz.

---

## 5. HT13G-M RFIC — 2 m / 70 cm Module

This chip is used on both the 2 m module (VHF chain only active) and the 70 cm module (UHF chain only active). Both chains are present on silicon; the inactive chain is powered down via SPI. This approach reuses a single die across two modules, reducing NRE cost and simplifying the OpenMPW submission.

### 5.1 Architecture

Both RX and TX chains use direct-conversion (zero-IF) IQ architecture. Each chain is fully independent: separate LNA, separate PLL/VCO, separate Σ-Δ ADC and DAC, separate I2S port. There is no shared LO between the VHF and UHF chains, providing > 60 dB inter-chain isolation.

## 6. HT13G-S RFIC — 23 cm Module

The 23 cm band (1240–1258 MHz) requires a separate RFIC. At 1.24 GHz the circuit topology changes compared to sub-500 MHz design — microstrip matching networks become practical and transmission line effects must be accounted for in layout. The SiGe HBT process remains entirely appropriate; fT of 300 GHz gives > 200× frequency headroom.

### 6.1 Architecture

Single-chain, single-band. Zero-IF direct conversion with on-chip LNA, IQ mixer, PLL/VCO, Σ-Δ ADC, Σ-Δ DAC, and IQ modulator. A single I2S port carries the IQ stream.

> **Note on VCO design at 1.24 GHz:** At this frequency the on-chip VCO inductor can be integrated as a bondwire-style element or a spiral inductor with adequate Q in the thick top metal layer (2–3 µm) of the SG13G2 Al BEOL. Phase noise is more challenging at L-band than at VHF/UHF. The target of < −100 dBc/Hz at 10 kHz offset is achievable with a high-Q LC tank; the SG13G2 Cu-BEOL option (SG13G2Cu) may be preferred for this design if the thick Cu layers provide sufficient inductor Q.

Identical to HT13G-M for SPI, PTT, IRQ, RESET_N, and VCTCXO_TUNE. Single I2S port (I2S_23CM) instead of two.

### 6.6 Power

| Rail | Voltage | RX current | TX current |
|------|---------|------------|------------|
| VDD_RF | 3.3 V | 45 mA (single chain) | 70 mA |
| VDD_CORE | 1.2 V (internal LDO) | 15 mA | 20 mA |
| VDD_IO | 1.8 V or 3.3 V selectable | 4 mA | 4 mA |
| **Total** | | **~200 mW** | **~282 mW** |

### 6.7 Package

- QFN-32 or QFN-40, 5×5 mm, 0.5 mm pitch

## 7. RF Signal Chain — Per Module

Each module presents the same external signal chain architecture regardless of band. Part numbers differ per band where necessary.

```

The SWR bridge is placed **between the PA output and the T/R switch**, after the harmonic filter, so it measures the power actually reaching the antenna port — including any mismatch at the connector and feedline. Forward and reflected power detector outputs feed a dual-channel ADC on the module PCB; the ADC result is read by the `ht-module-daemon` via I²C or SPI during transmit.

### 7.2 SWR Bridge and Power Measurement

#### 7.2.1 Directional Coupler / Bridge

A small-format directional coupler is placed in the TX path between the harmonic filter output and the T/R switch antenna port. At 5 W output power the coupler must handle full PA output continuously.

| Parameter | VHF (144 MHz) | UHF (432 MHz) | 23 cm (1240 MHz) |
|-----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| Topology | Transmission-line coupler or toroidal transformer coupler | same | Microstrip coupled-line section |
| Coupling factor | 20 dB (forward), 20 dB (reflected) | same | same |
| Directivity | > 20 dB | > 20 dB | > 18 dB |
| Insertion loss | < 0.3 dB | < 0.3 dB | < 0.5 dB |
| Power rating | > 10 W continuous | > 10 W continuous | > 10 W continuous |
| Implementation | SMD toroidal transformer (e.g. Coilcraft WBC series) | same | Hairpin microstrip on L1 |
| Termination | 50 Ω load on isolated port (forward detector); 50 Ω on through port (reflected detector) | same | same |

At VHF and UHF a small toroidal transformer coupler (wound on a ferrite bead, 4–6 turns, SMD construction) is practical and well-characterised. At 1240 MHz a microstrip coupled-line section on L1 is more reproducible and avoids ferrite performance variation at L-band.

#### 7.2.2 RF Power Detectors

Each coupler output (forward and reflected) drives an RF power detector diode. The detector output is a DC voltage proportional to the envelope of the coupled RF signal.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Detector diode | Skyworks SMS7630 or equivalent zero-bias Schottky |
| Detection range | −20 dBm to +10 dBm at detector input (20 dB coupling factor → 5 W = +37 dBm forward → +17 dBm at detector) |
| Output voltage range | ~50 mV to ~800 mV DC (log-linear characteristic) |
| Low-pass filter | 10 kΩ + 100 nF RC after each detector (3 dB at ~160 Hz — envelope following for CW/FM; not audio-following) |
| Supply | No supply required — zero-bias detector |

#### 7.2.3 Dual-Channel ADC

The two detector outputs (forward power, reflected power) are read by a dedicated dual-channel ADC on the module PCB. This ADC is separate from the RFIC and from the audio codec.

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Part (candidate) | MCP3202 (Microchip, 12-bit, dual-channel, SPI) or ADS1015 (TI, 12-bit, 4-channel, I²C) |
| Resolution | 12-bit |
| Interface | SPI (MCP3202) or I²C at address set by module address pins (ADS1015) |
| Sample rate | On-demand polling by `ht-module-daemon` during TX; no continuous streaming required |
| Supply | 3.3 V from module power rail |
| Reference | 3.3 V supply reference (adequate for SWR ratio computation; absolute accuracy not critical) |

#### 7.2.4 SWR Computation

The `ht-module-daemon` reads both ADC channels during TX and computes:

```
V_fwd  = ADC channel 0 (forward detector output, mV)
V_ref  = ADC channel 1 (reflected detector output, mV)

Gamma  = V_ref / V_fwd          (voltage reflection coefficient, linear)
SWR    = (1 + Gamma) / (1 - Gamma)

P_fwd  = calibrated from V_fwd using factory calibration table in module EEPROM
P_ref  = calibrated from V_ref using factory calibration table in module EEPROM
```

Factory calibration maps detector voltage to power in dBm at three reference points per band (stored in module EEPROM at offset 0x18 onwards — see [Section 9.5](#95-din-41612-connector-pin-assignment)). This allows accurate absolute power reporting without requiring the 3.3 V ADC reference to be a precision source.

**Automatic protection:** If SWR > 3.0 is measured during transmit, `ht-module-daemon` immediately:

1. De-asserts PA_EN (PA disabled)
2. De-asserts TR_SW (T/R switch returns to RX)
3. De-asserts PTT (RFIC TX path disabled)
4. Sets module fault state (`fault: true`, `fault_reason: "swr_high"`)
5. Publishes `swr_high` alert on the `status` ZMQ socket

The module will not transmit again until an operator issues `MOD_CLEAR_FAULT` after physically inspecting and correcting the antenna system. See [zeromq-messages.md Section 5.3](zeromq-messages.md#53-alert-messages) for the alert wire format.

#### 7.2.5 SWR Bridge Placement and Layout

- The coupler is placed on L1 in the RF zone, **after** the harmonic filter and **before** the T/R switch antenna port
- The two detector circuits (diode + RC filter) are placed immediately adjacent to the coupler ports, within 5 mm, to minimise parasitic pickup
- The ADC is placed in the mixed zone, away from the PA
- SPI or I²C traces from the ADC to the backplane run on L4, below the L5 ground plane shield
- At 1240 MHz, the microstrip coupler geometry is calculated for the L1 substrate (FR4, εr ≈ 4.5, h ≈ 0.18 mm to L2 ground plane)

### 7.3 Component Specifications

#### T/R Switch (Solid-state, per band)

| Parameter | VHF (144 MHz) | UHF (432 MHz) | 23 cm (1240 MHz) |
|-----------|:-------------:|:-------------:|:----------------:|
| Type | SPDT | SPDT | SPDT |
| Part (candidate) | SKY13351-378LF | SKY13351-378LF | SKY13384-350LF or PE4259 |
| Frequency | DC–3 GHz | DC–3 GHz | DC–3 GHz |
| Insertion loss | < 0.5 dB | < 0.5 dB | < 0.6 dB |
| TX→RX isolation | > 30 dB | > 30 dB | > 28 dB |
| Power handling | > 1 W continuous | > 1 W continuous | > 1 W continuous |
| Switching time | < 1 µs | < 1 µs | < 1 µs |
| Control | 2 GPIO from SpacemiT K3 (via backplane) | same | same |

The T/R switch is a key reliability element. Solid-state (PIN diode or CMOS SOI) switching is mandatory — no mechanical relays. All three bands can use the SKY13351 or its equivalent; at 1240 MHz insertion loss is slightly higher but remains acceptable.

**PTT sequencing is hardware-enforced:**

1. RFIC PTT assert (< 1 µs) — disables LNA path, enables TX DAC
2. T/R switch → TX position (< 1 µs)
3. 1 ms hardware delay
4. PA enable assert

On TX→RX transition the sequence reverses: PA de-assert → T/R switch RX → RFIC PTT release. This ensures the external LNA is never exposed to PA output power.

#### Variable Attenuator (RX path, per band)

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Part | pSemi PE4312 (1 MHz–4 GHz, valid for all three bands) |
| Range | 0–31.5 dB, 0.5 dB steps |
| Insertion loss at 0 dB | < 1 dB |
| Control | 6-bit SPI or parallel; latch enable from module GPIO |
| Purpose | Extends AGC range; prevents RFIC saturation on strong local signals |
| Supply | 3.3 V |

The PE4312 covers DC–4 GHz, making it suitable for all three bands with a single part number. At 1240 MHz, insertion loss increases slightly from the 1 MHz spec but remains under 1 dB.

#### External LNA (RX path, per band)

| Parameter | VHF / UHF | 23 cm |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Part (candidate) | PGA-103+ (Mini-Circuits) or BFP840ESD (Infineon) | BFP840ESD or MGFC4919G |
| Noise figure | < 0.8 dB | < 1.0 dB |
| Gain | 16–20 dB | 14–18 dB |
| Bias | 3.3 V, set by on-module bias resistor | same |
| Placement | Immediately after T/R switch, before attenuator | same |

The external LNA defines the system noise figure, which is dominated by the first active stage. Placing the LNA before the attenuator means the attenuator's insertion loss and the RFIC's noise figure are both divided by the LNA gain when referred to the input — a critical system noise figure improvement.

#### Power Amplifier (TX path, per band, 5 W output)

| Parameter | VHF | UHF | 23 cm |
|-----------|-----|-----|-------|
| Target output | 5 W (37 dBm) | 5 W (37 dBm) | 5 W (37 dBm) |
| Input power | 0 dBm from RFIC | same | same |
| Required gain | ~37 dB (two-stage) | ~37 dB | ~37 dB |
| Architecture | Driver + GaAs or LDMOS final | same | GaAs MMIC |
| Supply | 3.3–5 V from module power rail (regulated) | same | same |
| Efficiency | > 40% Class AB | > 40% | > 35% |
| Candidate ICs | VHF: RA07H1317M | UHF: RA07H4047M | 23 cm: RA07H1213M or MAAMSS0060 |
| Enable | GPIO from SpacemiT K3 via backplane, sequenced after T/R switch | same | same |

At 5 W output with 40% efficiency, the PA draws approximately 3.4 A at its supply voltage. The PA supply is provided directly from the backplane +12 V rail with no linear regulator in series — a linear regulator at this current would dissipate > 1.5 W as heat. Decoupling immediately at the PA supply pin: 220 µF electrolytic + 100 µF ceramic + 100 nF ceramic, placed within 2 mm of the supply pin.

#### Band-Pass / Harmonic Filter (TX path, per band)

A 7-element Chebyshev band-pass filter is placed between the PA output and the SWR bridge. It carries full TX power; component ratings must reflect this.

| Parameter | VHF filter | UHF filter | 23 cm filter |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|-------------|
| Passband | 130–175 MHz | 400–480 MHz | 1200–1300 MHz |
| Insertion loss | < 0.8 dB | < 0.8 dB | < 1.0 dB |
| Harmonic rejection (2nd) | > 60 dBc | > 60 dBc | > 60 dBc |
| Harmonic rejection (3rd+) | > 70 dBc | > 70 dBc | > 65 dBc |
| Implementation | SMD LC, 0402, tuned at assembly | same | same; consider hairpin microstrip at 1.24 GHz |
| Component ratings | Inductor > 1 A; capacitor > 30 V | same | same |
| PCB footprint | ~25 × 8 mm | ~20 × 8 mm | ~15 × 6 mm |

## 8. Module PCB Architecture

Each module is a single PCB on a **3U Eurocard form factor (100 × 160 mm per IEC 60297)**. The module is self-contained: all RF components, RFIC, SWR bridge, power conditioning, and backplane interface logic are on-board. The backplane interface uses a **Harting DIN 41612 Type C 96-pin connector** (2.54 mm pitch) plus **har-bus 64 hybrid power contacts** for the +12 V PA rail. KiCad standard library includes DIN 41612 footprints; no custom footprint is required.

### 8.1 Layer Stack (6-layer, identical for all three modules)

| Layer | Function |
|-------|----------|
| L1 top | RF routing + all RF components (RFIC, LNA, PA, BPF, SWR bridge, switches, attenuator) |
| L2 | Solid ground plane — unbroken RF reference; via-stitched at RF zone perimeter |
| L3 | Power distribution — 3.3 V, 5 V, 12 V PA rail |
| L4 | Secondary power + slow signals — SPI, I2S, GPIO, I²C, SWR ADC signals |
| L5 | Solid ground plane — shielding between digital and RF |
| L6 bottom | Backplane interface — DIN 41612 connector signals and power distribution |

### 8.2 Board Zoning

```

The RF zone perimeter is enclosed by a **double row of vias** connecting L2 to L5 at the boundary shown above. Via fences on I2S and SPI traces continue to within **2 mm** of the DIN 41612 connector footprint pads at the bottom edge.

### 8.3 RF Signal Routing Rules

| Rule | Value | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| 50 Ω microstrip width on L1 (FR4, L1→L2 ~0.18 mm) | ~0.35 mm | Impedance match throughout RF chain |
| Max trace length between RF components | < λ/10 at operating frequency | Minimise stub effects; at 1240 MHz λ/10 ≈ 24 mm |
| Bend style | 45° or curved; no 90° | Impedance discontinuity |
| Component size in RF path | 0402 max; 0201 preferred above 300 MHz | Minimise parasitic inductance |
| RFIC EPAD via array | 9 vias minimum (3×3) | RF and thermal ground |
| PA ground vias | Immediately adjacent to PA ground pad | Minimise source inductance |
| BPF placement | Immediately after PA output, before SWR bridge | Harmonics filtered before power measurement and antenna path |
| SWR bridge placement | After BPF, before T/R switch antenna port | Measures power at antenna interface, after filtering |
| Detector circuits | Within 5 mm of coupler ports | Minimise parasitic pickup on low-level detector outputs |
| SWR ADC traces | L4, below L5 ground plane | Isolate from RF zone |
| RP-SMA connector | Front-panel edge mount; coax land on L1 (default `-SMA` variant) | Use when panel space is tight or cables are short RP-SMA patches |
| Type-N connector | Front-panel bulkhead; same coax land (`-N` variant) | **Preferred when it fits** — fixed sites, outdoor enclosures, large coax |
| **Via fence — RF and high-speed data** | **Mandatory continuous via fences on both sides of the trace for the full routed length** | All RF signal paths and high-speed data lanes (I2S, SPI) must be enclosed; complements but does not replace shield cans |
| Via spacing (fence / stitch array) | ≤ λ/20 at highest operating frequency (12 mm @ 1240 MHz); **2–3 mm in practice** | Adequate isolation; via fences must connect L2 ground plane to L5 ground plane at regular intervals, stitching all ground layers together |
| RF zone perimeter via fence | **Double row** of vias at RF zone boundary (see Section 8.2) | RF isolation from digital and mixed zones |
| I2S / SPI via fence at connector | Continue to within **2 mm** of DIN 41612 connector footprint pads | Prevent backplane-edge coupling on high-speed lanes |
| Shield cans | **Mandatory** press-fit SMD cans over RF zone (Würth or Laird) | Physical shielding required; via fences complement but do not replace shield cans |

### 8.4 Test Points and Audio Monitoring

Every module exposes the following test points for bench characterisation and audio monitoring:

- RF test point between attenuator output and RFIC RX input (SMA footprint, unpopulated)
- RF test point between RFIC TX output and PA input (SMA footprint, unpopulated)
- RF test point between BPF output and SWR bridge input (SMA footprint, unpopulated) — allows calibration of the SWR bridge with a known source
- SWR detector output test points: two 0.1" pads (forward, reflected) for DC voltmeter connection during calibration
- SPI header (2×4, 2.54 mm) for RFIC direct configuration
- I2S header (1×6, 2.54 mm) for direct audio capture during testing
- **3.5 mm TRRS audio jack (populated on all variants)** — carries stereo IQ (I = Left, Q = Right) at baseband; allows direct monitoring or capture via any PC soundcard without the full backplane. Pinout follows Kenwood convention for compatibility with existing test equipment. In repeater operation, this port is available as a live audio monitoring tap.

### 8.5 Ground Plane and Copper Pour Thermal Policy

All ground copper pours on L1 (top) and L6 (bottom) serve a dual purpose: RF/signal reference and thermal mass/heatspreading.

- **L1 and L6 ground pours** must be thermally and electrically tied together through a regular array of thermal vias across the full board area (not only the RF zone).
- **L2 and L5 solid ground planes** must also be interconnected to L1 and L6 pours via the same via array — all six layers share a common ground with low thermal impedance between them.
- The **PA copper pour** (5 W output, ~7.5 W dissipation at 40% efficiency) immediately beneath and surrounding the PA footprint must be a **dedicated high-density via array** (minimum 3×3, 0.4 mm drill, 1 mm pitch) connecting L1 through to L2 and L3 to spread heat into the power plane.
- The module PCB must be designed to conduct heat **laterally to the card guide rails and chassis wall** — do not rely solely on convection. Copper pour continuity to the PCB edges (within DRC rules) is required.
- **KiCad thermal relief settings:** disable thermal relief spokes on all ground pour connections in the RF zone and PA area; use solid fills only — spokes increase thermal and RF impedance.

## 9. Backplane Interface

Each module communicates with the SpacemiT K3 compute module over the backplane via a **DIN 41612 Eurocard connector system**. The module PCB retains the 3U Eurocard form factor (100 × 160 mm per IEC 60297).

### 9.1 Connector System

| Connector | Type | Pitch | Rating | Function |
|-----------|------|-------|--------|----------|
| **J_BACKPLANE** | Harting DIN 41612 Type C, 96-pin (3-row: a/b/c) | 2.54 mm | 2 A per signal contact; gold over nickel mating surface | I2S, SPI, GPIO, I²C, VCTCXO_TUNE, and low-current power rails (+3.3 V, +1.8 V, +5 V) |
| **J_POWER** | Harting har-bus 64 hybrid power contacts | 5.08 mm | 6–15 A per contact | +12 V PA rail — minimum one dedicated power contact per module slot, rated comfortably above the 6 A (72 W) per-slot budget |

Where dedicated har-bus power contacts are not used for a high-current rail, a **minimum of four signal pins in parallel** per rail is required, with matched trace widths on the module PCB.

The 96-pin DIN 41612 connector provides sufficient capacity for all current and future module signals within the pin budget. No separate data-plane connector (equivalent to the former VITA 46 J1) is required or populated.

KiCad standard library includes DIN 41612 footprints; no custom footprint is required.

### 9.2 Data Transport: I2S over Backplane

The RFIC produces IQ samples as I2S audio streams (I = Left, Q = Right, 16-bit signed). At 500 kHz IQ bandwidth, the I2S bit clock is 16 MHz (500 kHz × 2 channels × 16 bits). This is a slow, deterministic serial bus — entirely compatible with routing over the DIN 41612 signal connector.

On the SpacemiT K3, each I2S stream maps to one SAI (Synchronous Audio Interface) peripheral:

| Module | RFIC I2S port | K3 SAI peripheral | ALSA device |
|--------|--------------|-------------------|-------------|
| 2 m | I2S_VHF | SAI1 | hw:0 (bench testing only) |
| 70 cm | I2S_UHF | SAI2 | hw:1 (bench testing only) |
| 23 cm | I2S_23CM | SAI3 | hw:2 (bench testing only) |

For the production repeater, the I2S streams are not presented to userspace via ALSA. Instead, a kernel driver or DMA path feeds the raw IQ samples directly into the ZeroMQ IPC layer (see Section 10). ALSA mapping is used only during bench testing.

### 9.3 Configuration: SPI over Backplane

Each module's RFIC is configured via SPI. The SPI bus is carried over the DIN 41612 signal connector. Each module has a unique chip-select line, allowing all three modules to share a single SPI bus from the K3.

The SWR ADC (MCP3202) shares the same SPI bus with a dedicated chip-select line per module, or uses I²C (ADS1015 variant) on the shared I²C backplane bus.

| Signal | Direction | Notes |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| SPI_CLK | K3 → all modules | Shared clock, up to 10 MHz |
| SPI_MOSI | K3 → all modules | Shared data |
| SPI_MISO | modules → K3 | Tri-stated when CS inactive |
| SPI_CS_2M | K3 → 2 m module | Active-low chip select (RFIC) |

| TEMP_23CM | module → K3 | same |

### 9.5 DIN 41612 Connector Pin Assignment

Pin designations follow the DIN 41612 / IEC 60603-2 naming convention: **rows a, b, c** (component side, viewed from the mating face); **columns 1–32**. The 96-pin Type C connector occupies columns 1–32 on all three rows.

**har-bus power contacts (J_POWER) — +12 V PA rail**

| Contact | Signal | Direction | Description |
|---------|--------|-----------|-------------|
| P1 | +12V_PA | PWR in | PA supply rail (direct backplane bus, decoupled on module); minimum one contact per slot, rated > 6 A |
| P2 | +12V_PA_RET | PWR return | PA return; paired with P1 |

A second har-bus contact pair may be populated for redundancy or current sharing on high-duty-cycle installs. If har-bus contacts are unavailable on a prototype backplane, use **four or more paralleled signal pins** on J_BACKPLANE with matched PCB trace widths (see paralleling note in Section 9.1).

**J_BACKPLANE — 96-pin signal connector (columns 1–16 assigned; 17–32 GND fence / reserved)**

Columns 1–8 carry power (low-current), SPI, and GPIO. Columns 9–16 carry I²C, VCTCXO, and I2S. Columns 17–32 are tied to GND on the module PCB (via-fence reference and reserved capacity).

| Pin | Signal | Direction | Description |

| a1 | GND | — | Ground |
| a2 | GND | — | Ground |
| a3 | +5V | PWR in | 5 V from backplane PSU |

**Notes on J_BACKPLANE:**

- `MOD_PRESENT` allows the K3 to detect which slots are populated at boot. The K3 reads `MOD_ID[1:0]` and module EEPROM to learn each module's band type. An empty slot presents high-impedance on all lines.
- `I2C_SDA/SCL` are shared across all module slots on the backplane I²C bus. Each module has a unique I²C address for its temperature sensor, EEPROM, and (if the ADS1015 ADC variant is fitted) SWR ADC. Temperature sensors use the LM75 / TMP102 family (7-bit address set by address pins on the module).
- `VCTCXO_TUNE` is a per-module signal — each module has its own RC-filtered PWM input from a separate K3 PWM channel, allowing independent VCTCXO discipline per band.
- `I2S_BCLK`, `I2S_LRCLK`, `I2S_DOUT`, `I2S_DIN` are per slot — each populated module occupies one SAI peripheral on the K3 (SAI mapping: slot A, B, C, D).
- All GPIO signals (PTT, TR_SW, PA_EN, ATT_LE, RFIC_RESET_N) are 1.8 V logic driven by the K3 EC-IO GPIO. The RFIC `VDD_IO` must be configured to 1.8 V on all modules to match. No level translation is required.
- `RFIC_IRQ_N` is an open-drain output from the module; a 10 kΩ pull-up to 1.8 V is on the module PCB.
- `SPI_CS_ADC_N` is a separate chip-select for the SWR ADC (MCP3202 variant). If the I²C ADC variant (ADS1015) is fitted instead, this pin is NC and the ADC is addressed via `I2C_SDA/SCL`.
- I2S and SPI traces require continuous via fences on both sides for their full routed length, extending to within 2 mm of the connector pads (see Section 8.3).

**Module identity EEPROM**

Each module carries a small I²C EEPROM (24C02 or equivalent, 256 bytes) at a unique address determined by address pins tied to VCC or GND on the module. The EEPROM stores:

| Byte offset | Content |
|-------------|---------|
| 0x00–0x01 | Module type (0x0001 = 2 m, 0x0002 = 70 cm, 0x0003 = 23 cm) |
| 0x02–0x03 | Hardware revision |
| 0x04–0x13 | Serial number (16 ASCII bytes) |
| 0x14–0x17 | Factory calibration: VCTCXO trim offset (int32, ppb) |
| 0x18–0x1F | Factory calibration: SWR forward detector — 3-point table (voltage → dBm), 3 × int16 pairs |
| 0x20–0x27 | Factory calibration: SWR reflected detector — 3-point table (voltage → dBm), 3 × int16 pairs |
| 0x28–0x2B | Factory calibration: PA output power calibration point (uint32, dBm × 100) |
| 0x2C–0xFF | Reserved |

The `ht-module-daemon` reads this EEPROM at startup to identify each installed module, load its calibration constants, and set the correct VCTCXO trim starting point before GNSS discipline takes over. The SWR detector calibration tables are loaded into the daemon's memory and used for all subsequent SWR computations during TX.

### 9.6 Antenna connector options — RP-SMA or Type-N

Analog RF leaves the module T/R switch through one front-panel coax jack. The PCB layout supports **RP-SMA** (default) or **Type-N** on the same 50 Ω microstrip land. This choice affects only the faceplate RF port.

#### Default: RP-SMA

```
T/R switch ── SWR Bridge ── BPF ── RP-SMA (front panel) ── coax ── antenna
```

Standard production fitment. Use when the 3U module front panel lacks depth or clearance for a Type-N bulkhead, or when the site plan uses only short RP-SMA patch cables (bench, indoor cabinet).

#### Option: Type-N (N connector) — preferred when it fits

```
T/R switch ── SWR Bridge ── BPF ── Type-N (front panel) ── coax ── antenna
```

| Why Type-N is better (when it fits) | Detail |
|-------------------------------------|--------|
| Mechanical | Threaded mate; tolerates vibration and repeated tightening on a fixed install |
| Weather | Bulkhead jacks suit outdoor enclosures and exposed repeater cabinets |
| Coax compatibility | Natural mate to LMR-400, LMR-600, and other site feedline used on repeaters |
| Loss | Lower contribution from the connector interface at 432 MHz and 1240 MHz than RP-SMA, especially with large cable |
| Site practice | Common on commercial and amateur repeater hardware at UHF and above |

Order **`-N`** per module when the panel cutout and enclosure depth accommodate a Type-N bulkhead and the antenna run justifies it. **23 cm** modules at permanent sites should default to Type-N unless panel constraints forbid it. **2 m** modules may remain RP-SMA on compact builds.

Type-N does **not** replace the DIN 41612 backplane connector.

**Module PCB variants:**

| Variant | Front-panel RF | When to order |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
| `-SMA` (default) | RP-SMA populated | Compact panel, indoor/cabinet, short patches |
| `-N` | Type-N populated | Type-N fits the panel and site coax — preferred for fixed outdoor repeaters |

One connector type per module at assembly. IQ (I2S on J_BACKPLANE), SPI, GPIO, EEPROM, SWR monitoring, and ZeroMQ are unchanged between variants.

**Layout:** Type-N bulkheads need a larger panel opening and slightly more depth than RP-SMA. If the cutout cannot be made without violating the Section 8.3 λ/10 trace-length rule, stay on `-SMA` rather than forcing Type-N.

## 10. Software Interface: ZeroMQ IPC

In the repeater context, IQ data flows from each module RFIC through the backplane into the SpacemiT K3, where it is processed by GNU Radio 4.0 or SDRangel. ZeroMQ (ZMQ) is used as the inter-process communication layer between the low-level hardware driver and the signal processing application.

### 10.1 Why ZeroMQ for IQ transport

ZeroMQ provides:

- **Decoupling** — the hardware driver and the signal processing application are separate processes; neither blocks the other
- **Flexibility** — the same ZMQ socket can be consumed by GNU Radio, SDRangel, a recording daemon, and a monitoring process simultaneously (PUB/SUB pattern)
- **Network transparency** — a ZMQ PUB socket can publish IQ data over TCP to a remote workstation for off-site processing or monitoring, with no code changes
- **Native GNU Radio support** — GNU Radio 4.0 includes ZMQ source and sink blocks (`gr-zeromq`) as first-class blocks

### 10.2 IQ Data Flow

### 10.3 ZeroMQ Socket Layout

| Socket | Pattern | Address | Direction | Contents |
|--------|---------|---------|-----------|----------|
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/iq_A` | PUB | local | Module A -> consumers | Raw IQ, int16 interleaved, 500 kHz |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/iq_B` | PUB | local | Module B -> consumers | Raw IQ, int16 interleaved, 500 kHz |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/iq_C` | PUB | local | Module C -> consumers | Raw IQ, int16 interleaved, 500 kHz |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/iq_D` | PUB | local | Module D -> consumers | Raw IQ, int16 interleaved, 500 kHz |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/tx_A` | SUB | local | GNU Radio -> module A | TX IQ data stream |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/tx_B` | SUB | local | GNU Radio -> module B | TX IQ data stream |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/tx_C` | SUB | local | GNU Radio -> module C | TX IQ data stream |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/tx_D` | SUB | local | GNU Radio -> module D | TX IQ data stream |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/ctrl` | REQ/REP | local | Any process -> daemon | Per-module: frequency, gain, PTT, squelch, TX timeout, attenuator, SWR query, fault clear ([zeromq-messages.md](zeromq-messages.md)) |
| `ipc:///run/ht-module/status` | PUB | local | Daemon -> consumers | RSSI, AGC state, PLL lock, temperature, SWR, forward/reflected power, fault state |

For remote monitoring or distributed processing, IPC sockets can be exposed as TCP sockets by changing the address to `tcp://0.0.0.0:<port>` — no other code changes required.

### 10.4 Frame Format

Full binary layout, control commands, status JSON (including SWR fields), and gr-ident integration:
**[zeromq-messages.md](zeromq-messages.md)**.

IQ frames are published as length-prefixed binary messages:

```
[ 8 bytes: uint64 timestamp (nanoseconds, GNSS-disciplined) ]
[ 4 bytes: uint32 module identifier (0=A, 1=B, 2=C, 3=D) ]
[ 4 bytes: uint32 sample count in this frame ]
[ N×4 bytes: int16 I, int16 Q interleaved, little-endian ]
```

The 64-bit nanosecond timestamp uses the system clock disciplined by chrony + GNSS PPS (see Section 6 of the main system document), providing accurate cross-band timing for any synchronisation analysis.

### 10.5 `ht-module-daemon` Functions

> **Implementation status:** Specified here and in [zeromq-messages.md](zeromq-messages.md). Source code is **not** in the SDR-repeater repository; implement in a separate **Rust** repo per [implementation-language.md](implementation-language.md) and [repo-map.md](repo-map.md).

The `ht-module-daemon` is a single Rust daemon responsible for:

- Initialising all three module RFICs via SPI on startup; loading SWR calibration tables from each module's EEPROM
- Reading module temperature sensors via I²C (backplane bus) and publishing via status socket
- Managing the PTT sequence (hardware-enforced order: RFIC PTT → T/R switch → 1 ms delay → PA enable) in response to `ctrl` socket commands
- Setting attenuator values via SPI in response to `ctrl` socket commands
- **Polling the SWR ADC on each transmitting module** at regular intervals during TX (recommended: every 100 ms); computing SWR from forward and reflected detector voltages using the EEPROM calibration table; publishing `swr`, `fwd_w`, and `ref_w` in the `status` JSON
- **Auto-disabling any module whose SWR exceeds 3.0:** immediately de-asserting PA_EN, TR_SW, and PTT in that order; setting the module's fault state; publishing a `swr_high` alert; blocking subsequent PTT commands until `MOD_CLEAR_FAULT` is received
- Managing VCTCXO frequency discipline: reading GNSS 1PPS interrupt from K3 GPIO, computing correction, updating PWM duty cycle for each module's VCTCXO_TUNE input
- Monitoring RFIC IRQ lines (PLL unlock, AGC threshold events) and publishing alerts via `status` socket
- Routing TX IQ from ZMQ SUB to SAI DMA TX path

This mirrors the `ht13g-spi` CLI and HT Daemon described in the OpenHT-DB software stack, adapted for three independent modules and the absence of display/keypad/audio hardware.

### 10.6 GNU Radio Integration

A GNU Radio OOT (out-of-tree) module `gr-ht13g` provides:

- `ht13g_source` — ZMQ SUB block; receives IQ from `ht-module-daemon`; outputs `complex float` stream
- `ht13g_sink` — ZMQ PUB block; accepts `complex float` TX stream; sends to daemon
- `ht13g_ctrl` — Python block; sends control commands (frequency, PTT, gain, fault clear) via `ctrl` REQ/REP socket
- `ht13g_monitor` — Python block; subscribes to `status` PUB socket; exposes RSSI, SWR, PLL lock, and fault state as GRC variables for flowgraph-level monitoring and alerting

For cross-band repeat (e.g. receive on module A, 2 m, retransmit on module B, 70 cm), a single GNU Radio flowgraph subscribes to `iq_A`, demodulates, re-encodes, and publishes to `tx_B`. The daemon handles T/R switching and SWR protection for each module independently, with no coordination required between modules in the flowgraph.

## 11. MPW Tapeout Strategy

Full dual-band or triple-band integration on a single die would require approximately 4–6 mm² including the sealring — exceeding the 2 mm² community slot in the OpenMPW program. The strategy is therefore to submit and validate each chain independently before integration.

### 11.1 Recommended Submission Sequence

| Phase | Shuttle | Design | Goal |
|-------|---------|--------|------|
| 1 | SG13G2 (next available) | VHF RX chain only — LNA + IQ mixer + ADC stub | Validate noise figure, IIP3, ADC at 144 MHz |
| 2 | SG13G2 (following) | UHF RX chain only — same topology, 432 MHz | Validate UHF chain performance |
| 3 | SG13G2 | 23 cm RX chain — cascode LNA + IQ mixer + ADC, 1240 MHz | Validate L-band NF and phase noise |
| 4 | SG13G2 | VHF TX chain — DAC + IQ modulator + PA driver | Validate IQ balance, harmonic suppression |
| 5 | SG13G2 | UHF TX chain | same at 432 MHz |
| 6 | SG13G2 | HT13G-M full dual-chain integration | First full die; area ~3–4 mm² → commercial MPW run |
| 7 | SG13G2 | HT13G-S full 23 cm integration | Full 23 cm die; area ~1.5–2 mm² → fits community slot |

Phases 1–5 each fit within the 2 mm² community slot and can be submitted to the IHP OpenMPW program at no cost. Phases 6–7 require either a commercial MPW slot or a larger-area community allocation.

### 11.2 Current MPW Schedule (SG13G2 / SG13CMOS5L)

Based on the published IHP schedule as of May 2026:

- **Next SG13G2 MPW run:** October 4, 2026 (tapeout deadline approximately August 2026)
- **Next SG13CMOS5L MPW run:** November 15, 2026 (tapeout deadline approximately May 2026) — alternative for digital/control blocks or CMOS-only prototypes; see [Alternative processes](#alternative-processes)
- Turn-around time for SG13G2: approximately 8 months from tapeout to die delivery; SG13CMOS5L runs typically have shorter turn-around

A Phase 1 (VHF RX chain) submission targeting the October 2026 run would receive silicon approximately June 2027. All measurement results must be published open-source per the OpenMPW program requirements.

## 12. Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| HT13G-M VHF PLL phase noise at 144 MHz | Medium | SiGe HBT VCOs at VHF well-characterised; validate VHF chain in Phase 1 MPW before integration |
| DC offset in zero-IF VHF chain | Medium–High | Standard direct-conversion challenge; digital feedback loop in spec; calibrate on startup via `ht-module-daemon` |
| IQ imbalance at 1240 MHz (HT13G-S) | Medium–High | L-band IQ balance harder than VHF/UHF; on-chip IQ calibration registers; measured and corrected at startup |
| IHP MPW 2 mm² area insufficient for full HT13G-M die | High | Planned; individual chain validation in community slots before commercial MPW submission |
| 5 W PA thermal dissipation on module | Medium | 40% efficiency → 7.5 W total at full power; dedicated PA copper pour with high-density via array (3×3 minimum, 0.4 mm drill, 1 mm pitch, L1–L3); L1/L6 ground pour heatspreading to card guides and chassis wall per Section 8.5; duty-cycle limiting in firmware; module slot pitch provides ventilation |
| SWR bridge directivity at VHF (144 MHz) | Medium | Toroidal transformer couplers at VHF can exhibit reduced directivity below 150 MHz; validate directivity at 144 MHz on bench; adjust winding ratio or use transmission-line coupler if directivity < 20 dB |
| SWR detector calibration drift with temperature | Low–Medium | Schottky detector diodes have temperature-dependent characteristics; three-point calibration table in EEPROM covers nominal temperature; consider two-temperature calibration table in future EEPROM revision |
| PE4312 insertion loss at 1240 MHz | Low | Rated to 4 GHz; at 1.24 GHz insertion loss rises slightly but remains < 2 dB; acceptable for system NF budget |
| DIN 41612 I2S signal integrity over backplane | Low | I2S at 16 MHz bit clock is well within DIN 41612 routing capability; series termination 33 Ω; mandatory via fences on I2S and SPI traces per Section 8.3 |
| ZMQ IPC latency causing TX audio artefacts | Low | ZMQ PUB/SUB is sub-millisecond at localhost; hardware PTT sequencing (1 ms delay) already dominates latency |
| SG13G2Cu BEOL availability for 23 cm VCO inductors | Medium | Standard Al BEOL thick layer may suffice; Cu BEOL option available from IHP at additional cost if Q is insufficient |
| SKY13351 availability (supply chain) | Low | Multiple equivalent SPDT RF switches available (pSemi, MACOM); footprint-compatible alternatives exist |
